//compilers and interpreters - js use english lang and computer can not understand they us=nderstand 0 1 as signals 
// - and to convert our lang to computer understandable lang we use a translator
// - compilers and interpreter are the translator to convert the code
// - compiler - convert to machine code (faster code) and compiler has slower conversion rate
// - interpreter - convert to byte code (slower code) and interpretation has faster conversion rate 
//               - byte code again get converted to machine code
// js has inbuilt interpreter
// google has developed jit compiler (just in time) - it use the ability of compiler and interpreter

//window - collection of all the tools
